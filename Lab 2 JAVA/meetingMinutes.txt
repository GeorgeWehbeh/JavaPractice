meeting 3 11am-12pm
july 5th

Hiba brings up issue of Joanna not making it to first meeting 

George suggests giving her a chance as she may be busy and will hopefully come through for later meetings 

Group agrees to begin discussing how we are going to break up the report

Hiba brings up concern on joana completing her part as she has been unable to attend meetings

We come to the decision to assign her parts and let her know what she is responsible for in our groupchat but also make sure that we break up her work umongst ourselves as a backup plan

George and Hiba agree to split work on the report

Ruwi and Joana agree to split work on the report but if joana remains unavalable George and Hiba will split work with her

Discuss on how we are going to break up the report with some difficulty as many of the parts rely on a previous part which would require a lot of back and forth adding complexity and time  

Decide to go with breaking up the body of the report into Introduction + Recomendation for Hiba, George will do results, discussion, cunclusions

Once we have completed these parts we will bring everything together and work on front matter and back matter over a meeting
